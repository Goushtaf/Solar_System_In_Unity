Hello!
In this project, I tried using Unity to make a Solar System and predict the path the bodys are going to take in the future.
This is extremly poorly optimised so if you have so advices it's nice! Have fun creating planets if you use it.
You can find every script I wrote in Assets/scripts, with the most interesting script being DrawPath.cs.
It was also the first time I used C# so it may be poorly written.
